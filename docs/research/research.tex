    I am currently researching how to find the BPM of a song below are some formula I was recommended.
    \section{On-Set Detection}
        \subsection{Sound energy algorithm}
            From link below \\
            The algorithm divides the data into blocks of samples and compares the energy of a block
            with the energy of a preceding window of blocks. The energy of a block is used to detect a beat. If the
            energy is above a certain threshold then the block is considered to contain a beat. The threshold is defined
            starting from the average energy of the window of blocks preceding the one we are analyzing.\\
            If a block j is made of 1024 samples and the song is stereo, its energy can be computed as:
            \[E_j = \sum_{i=0}^{1023}left[i]^2 + right[i]^2  \]
            This technique was deemed imprecise by the article.


    \section{Terms}
        If any are left blank go look em up!\\
         \textbf{Sampling Frequency} - the number of samples per second in a Sound \\
         \textbf{Discrete wavelet transform} - \\
         \textbf{} - \\
